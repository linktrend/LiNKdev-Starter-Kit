# Cursor Project Rules (.mdc)
# This file applies only to this project (template monorepo).

rules:
  - description: >
      Always ensure the web application follows the locked user-facing navigation and developer console structure.
      Do not modify the mobile app navigation; it will follow its own design.
      Where possible, maximize shared components (forms, UI primitives, typography, colors, etc.) across web and mobile.

    applies_to: ["web"]

    instructions: |
      The web application must have two entry experiences:

      1. User-Facing App (yourapp.com)
         - Landing Page (public): marketing sections (features, pricing, testimonials, docs) + Sign Up + Login
         - After Sign Up: registration → onboarding → homepage
         - After Login: homepage
         - Homepage (primary landing screen): acts as Dashboard / Feed / Log depending on app type
         - From homepage, user can access:
           • Feature Modules (dynamic, app-specific)
           • Profile
           • Account / Organization
           • Settings
           • Billing & Subscriptions
           • Notifications
           • Help / Support / Docs
           • Admin (role-based)

      2. Developer Console (console.yourapp.com or /console)
         - Separate login page (not shared with user login)
         - After login: Developer Console Home, with collapsible left sidebar navigation to:
           • System Health & Logs
           • Database / Records Viewer
           • Jobs / Background Tasks
           • Feature Flags & Config
           • Environment Management
           • Integrations & Webhooks
           • Automations (n8n, others)
           • API Monitoring
           • Error Tracking & Alerts
           • Analytics / Usage Metrics
           • Audit & Security Logs
           • Security & Access Control

      If Cursor detects the structure is different, it should recommend aligning it
      but take no direct action unless explicitly instructed.

  - description: >
      The mobile application is structured separately and may have different navigation.
      Do not apply the web navigation rules to the mobile side.

    applies_to: ["mobile"]

    instructions: |
      For mobile, follow its own navigation system (likely bottom nav or stack-based),
      but ensure shared UI primitives and design tokens are reused with the web app.
