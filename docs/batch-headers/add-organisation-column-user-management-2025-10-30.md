## Batch Header: Add Organisation column to User Management table

- Scope: 1–2 hours to add an Organisation column left of User in Security & Access > User Management table, with data wired or mocked.
- Inputs:
  - Codebase components/pages for Security & Access screens
  - Existing table implementation (shadcn/ui DataTable or custom)
  - Project scripts and testing setup
- Plan:
  - Locate the Security & Access User Management table component
  - Add an Organisation column positioned to the left of the User column
  - Wire real organisation data; if not readily available, inject a temporary mock mapping
  - Ensure consistent styling using Tailwind and shadcn/ui patterns
  - Surface errors via non-obtrusive feedback (toasts or inline)
  - Update/add tests (unit for column config, integration/E2E minimal happy path)
  - Run lint, typecheck, build; fix issues
- Risks & Assumptions:
  - Assumption: Table uses a central columns config that’s easy to extend
  - Risk: No immediate organisation data on the row model; may need mock data or a join
  - Assumption: shadcn/ui + Tailwind are used; if not, mimic existing style system
  - Risk: Route or component names may differ; will discover and adapt
- Script Additions: None planned; will reuse existing scripts
