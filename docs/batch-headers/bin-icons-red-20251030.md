- Scope: 1–2 hours (small UI consistency update)
- Inputs: `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css`, lucide usages found via search (e.g., `Trash`, `Trash2`)
- Plan:
  - Add a Tailwind component layer rule in `globals.css` that targets lucide trash icons (`.lucide-trash`, `.lucide-trash-2`) and applies a red text color.
  - Limit scope to icon color so all icon-only delete buttons render red without changing behavior.
  - Avoid per-file edits; rely on global style for consistency.
- Risks & Assumptions:
  - Assumes bin icons are rendered via lucide (`Trash`, `Trash2`) across the app.
  - If any custom SVGs are used for bins without lucide classes, they won’t be affected; can be addressed later if needed.
  - Styling rule requires Tailwind utilities; we’ll use `@apply` in a components layer.
- Script Additions: None.
